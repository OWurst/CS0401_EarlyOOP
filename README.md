# CS0401_EarlyOOP
This was a project I did at UPitt for CS0401, Intermediate Programming with Java. This was one of my earliest introductions to Object-Oriented Programming, and it is a simple program utilizing all for of the OOP concepts (abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism). Motorcycle, Truck, and Car are all subclasses of Vehicle, and the program reads in a list of vehicles and creates these objects accordingly, all of which must have different data associated with them. The file to read in must be in the format found in vehicle_data.txt, and there are some additional directions in formatting an input file in the comments of Fleet.java
